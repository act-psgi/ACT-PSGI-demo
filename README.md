# ACT-PSGI-demo

A demo instance for the ACT-PSGI fork.

Will soon include template, assets & config.

For now "only" a container to collect issues with https://act-test.plix.at/demo. Please **do not** add issues for general ACT features/bugs, only for things that work in the current/legacy ACT, but don't work here in the PSGI fork!
